# MagicMirror

This is a JAVA project built with GRADLE and at the end it creates an executable JAR file.

There are four widgets in this JAVAFX application, one displays the weather and the other displays a calendar 
with all the information pulled from your Google account, another is a twitter feed, and lastly there is a clock widget.

Update the project so that GRADLE can grab all of the dependancies.




There are 4 HTML files that can be used to load some widgets inside a browser withtout the need of Java, just pure JS and HTML.

You will need an API Key from Google, with the Calendar API enabled and the domain set to localhost:8000

Put your API Key inside the Calendar.html file, where <API_KEY> is.

Now run a local server by typing this into the terminal. "python3 http.server 8000"

Got to your browser and go to "localhost:8000/Desktop/Mirror.html

The current setup needs the html files on your desktop.
